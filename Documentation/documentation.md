our final project â€”called  "Sports finder" and it's a platform that helps users to create sports events and keep track of
the newest event that has been published by other users. it is not hosted on a publicly-available server,
so local hosting is required to open the site. Sports finder is built upon pset7 so it should configure similarly plus
you might need to install some libraries like (dateutil).

to use sports finder you have first to create a user account. Registration requires a name, password,
email address and an account photo. The username, the password and the photo can be changed later, however, there are permanent.

After regestration and signing in, user will be redirected to welcome page and will see two buttons that say:
(create an event) and (join an event), and friendly welcome above. and now it goes in two directions.

first case: clicking on create an event where the user will be redirected to another page where s/he could create an event and,
for sure the user has to type some info about the event so this will require a name of the event, location, date, time,
description and for sure the type of the sport that you like to have this event about.

so after that, the user will be redirected to a page called event where s/he will see a clearer info about the event that s/he created.

second case: clicking on (join an event) where the user will be redirected to a page called "event page" where he could see a list of
all the events, sorted from the newest to the oldest and there will be a button called join so s/he could join the event that s/he like.
also there will be a link on the name that will lead him/her to the event details.

at nav bar, the user will have my page where s/he will have a list of all the events which s/he is participating in.
Added to this s/he will have his/her image on this list.

there will be also my account option where the user will be able to change his/her name, password, or even image.

and for sure there will be "about us" option which is one page that displays our team and the people who have to work on this project
